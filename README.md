## Plan on improving the project

As the days go by i want to think of this project as an improving piece of work that can be used by our customers. We are improving our project by making it delivery friendly. You can be able to place an order online to be delivered to you. We are also working on bringing more menu varietys for snacks and drinks.

## Reason for creatig the project

The project was created to let clients know that we have an awesome internal feature within our Triple Peaks Library. Not only can you read books but you can stop by the cafeteria and have a refreshment while you sit and read.
